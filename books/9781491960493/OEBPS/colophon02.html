  <h1>Colophon</h1>

  <p>The animal on the cover of <em>Making Data Visual</em> is the dwarf gourami (<em>Trichogaster lalius</em>). Native to South Asia, these omnivorous, freshwater fish are typically found near the surface of slow-moving water in streams and lakes. Dwarf gouramis grow to about 3.5 inches in length. Males are diagonally striped in red and blue with narrow, pointed dorsal fins, whereas females are silvery with larger, rounded fins.</p>

  <p>Because of their labyrinth organ—an auxiliary breathing organ that allows them to utilize oxygen directly from the air—these fish can survive in poorly oxygenated water as long as they have access to the surface. Slow-moving and still water provide an opportunity for males to build “bubble nests” out of dead, floating plant matter, which hold up to 800 fertilized eggs at a time. Incubation is complete within one day, and three days after hatching, spawn are capable of swimming beyond the safety of the nest.</p>

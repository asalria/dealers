<p>It does not necessarily take a sophisticated visual representation to make a compelling point or understand a complex dataset.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="single views" id="ix_sinvi"></a> Many of the most discussed, most viral, and most interesting visualizations are based on basic chart types. In this chapter, we’ll take a look at some of the familiar core chart types. This is well-trodden territory—a sample of some different approaches can be found in <a data-type="xref" href="#FurtherReadingSingleview">“Further Reading”</a>, including attempts to taxonomize the space in different ways.</p>

<p>This chapter takes a somewhat different approach to organizing core chart types. It is organized around the things that the analyst knows, and wants to know, about the data. This follows from the process of operationalizing the data (<a data-type="xref" href="ch02.html#operationalization">Chapter 2</a>), interviewing users (<a data-type="xref" href="ch03.html#DataCounseling">Chapter 3</a>), and understanding the data’s shape and the actions we can take with it (<a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#ComponentsOfVisualization">Chapter 4</a>). The operationalization has helped reveal something about <em>how the data is structured</em> and <em>what questions there are about it.</em>  This knowledge can be used to select chart types based on specific data questions.</p>

<p>Depending on the analyst’s task and question, visualizations can emphasize different results from the same dataset. For example, the United States Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has released information about consumer complaints and how they were resolved across a number of different financial products. Among other columns, the data describes the class of financial products to which a complaint applies and the type of relief that the complaint received. The examples in the following figures aggregate that data to just three dimensions: the product, the number of claims that had some form of relief, and the number of claims that did not.</p>

<p>The list of visuals in this section can never be exhaustive, and new chart types are being created all the time. <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="stacked bar charts" id="idm140386944787952"></a>This set, however, addresses many of the major categories and the vast majority of charts found in the wild. The list of charts is arranged by a set of common data questions according to which they are most effective at supporting.</p>

<p>This chapter first gives a quick primer of perceptual concepts that underlie the construction of these basic charts. After that, the charts are organized by data question. An overview of that organization is shown in <a data-type="xref" href="#overviewtable">Table 5-1</a>. The language here is intentionally informal because it is meant to work as a reference for helping to map an operationalization to visualization solutions.</p>

<p><a data-type="xref" href="#overviewtable">Table 5-1</a> uses the data types from <a data-type="xref" href="ch04.html#types_of_data">“Types of Data”</a>. <em>C</em> is for categorical, <em>Q</em> for continuous (quantitative), and <em>O</em> for ordinal data. <em>V</em> represents any data type that can be mapped to a drawing attribute, like color or line thickness. <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="data" data-secondary="types of" id="idm140386944778688"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="quantitative data" data-seealso="continuous data" id="idm140386944778176"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="categorical data" id="idm140386944777664"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="continuous data" id="idm140386944777280"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="ordinal data" id="idm140386944776896"></a>If a drawing supports <em>Q×Q</em>, that means it supports a dataset with two continuous columns.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="visualizations" data-secondary="questions and corresponding visualizations" id="idm140386944775120"></a></p>

<section data-type="sect1" data-pdf-bookmark="Overall Perceptual Concerns"><div class="sect1" id="idm140386944721840">
<h1>Overall Perceptual Concerns</h1>

<p>The strengths and weaknesses of human perception drive much of the design of visualizations.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="perceptual concepts" id="idm140386944718656"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="single views" data-secondary="perceptual concerns" id="idm140386944718272"></a> Basic perceptual concepts apply across all visualization types. The term <em>encoding channel</em> refers to the ways that an attribute is represented in the visualization.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="encoding channels" id="idm140386944716896"></a> In a bar chart, for example, bar length encodes a value, whereas the textual bar caption encodes the category.  Different channels have very different perceptual properties, which can be described in terms of how quickly and accurately a reader can interpret them as well as how much they stand out from each other.</p>

<p>There is a well-known hierarchy of accuracy: overall, readers are faster and more accurate when comparing lengths or positions than area (see <a data-type="xref" href="#perception_comparison">Figure 5-5</a>).<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="perceptual concepts" data-secondary="hierarchy of accuracy in comparisons" id="idm140386944716288"></a> Roughly, the hierarchy runs from length to arc angle, to area to color hue and intensity (<a data-type="xref" href="#perception_comparison">Figure 5-5</a>). All else being equal, then, bar charts (which use length) are likely to be preferable to treemaps, which use area. (To read more on this topic, see the article by Cleveland and McGill cited under <a data-type="xref" href="#relevant_articles_6">“Relevant Articles”</a>.)</p>

<figure><div id="perception_comparison" class="figure">
<img src="images/mdvi_0505.png" alt="mdvi 0505" />
<h6><span class="label">Figure 5-5. </span>Difficulty in comparison increases roughly from left to right: comparing length with a shared baseline and with different baselines, comparing angles, comparing square areas or circular areas, and comparing color. Each of these shows three values in the proportion 5:1:3.</h6>
</div></figure>

<p>Color is difficult to use effectively. A small number of well-chosen colors can be highly distinguishable, particularly for categorical data, but it can be difficult for users to distinguish between more than a handful of colors in a visualization.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="perceptual concepts" data-secondary="colors in visualizations" id="idm140386944705728"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="color" data-secondary="in visualizations" id="idm140386944706432"></a> Nonetheless, color is an invaluable tool in the visualization toolbox because it is a channel that can carry a great deal of meaning and be overlaid on other dimensions. A number of the visualizations described in this chapter use a color scale, such as heatmaps and choropleths. There are a variety of perceptual effects, such as simultaneous contrast and color deficiencies, that make precise numerical judgments about a color scale difficult, if not impossible. As such, it is vital to choose color palettes with care.</p>

<p>There are other important conventions.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="perceptual concepts" data-secondary="lines in visualizations" id="idm140386944709360"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="lines (in visualizations)" id="idm140386944707680"></a> Lines should connect things that go together, and in most cases, it should be meaningful to look halfway along a line.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="objects" data-secondary="in visualizations, perception of" id="idm140386944709008"></a> Objects in visualizations that are stacked atop each other are typically read as to be summed together: their total area is the sum of the areas of their components (<a data-type="xref" href="#ch6_img2">Figure 5-2</a>).<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="stacked bar charts" id="idm140386944702384"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="treemaps" id="idm140386944703488"></a> This is as true in a stacked bar chart as it is in a treemap. Conversely, when areas are discontinuous—two different bars side by side—the analyst expects the viewer to compare them. <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="clustered bar charts" id="idm140386944699552"></a>Closer-together things are easier to compare than further-apart things; thus, a clustered bar chart suggests that the bars in each cluster should be considered in relation to each other, and then the clusters themselves in relation to one another (Figures <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="#ch6_img3">5-3</a> versus <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="#ch6_img4">5-4</a>).</p>

<p>None of the data visualizations in this chapter use a three-dimensional perspective.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="3D data" id="idm140386944695552"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="perceptual concepts" data-secondary="three-dimensional data" id="idm140386944695056"></a> There is an entire research area dedicated to 3D data—physical structures, bodies, weather systems—and many tools meant to visualize things that truly have three spatial dimensions. In our experience and in the experience of many others, using three dimensions tends to lead to challenges in perception: points in space occlude each other; perspective makes it hard to compare sizes; the extra dimension of depth tends to obscure information. Thus, visualization design principles tend to reserve 3D visualization techniques to tasks that are meant to explore the 3D shape of spatial data.</p>

<p>There are a number of excellent resources on the topic of perception for visualization; see <a data-type="xref" href="#FurtherReadingSingleview">“Further Reading”</a>.</p>

<p>A quantitative histogram shows the distribution of a continuous or ordinal variable.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="histograms" data-secondary="quantitative" id="idm140386944673440"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="continuous data" data-secondary="quantitative histogram of" id="idm140386944672592"></a> It can help identify whether the data is skewed in one direction or another—that is, whether the data is top-heavy or bottom-heavy, or whether there are gaps in the middle of the range or outliers at the end. If there is a small enough number of discrete values, they can be treated as categories.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="binning" data-secondary="in quantitative histogram" id="idm140386944676256"></a> Otherwise, the data is binned into ranges and each range gets its own bar.

<p>This chart is not really different from the categorical histogram.

It can identify such features as the average, standard deviation, and outliers for multiple distributions. <a data-type="xref" href="#box_plot">Figure 5-9</a> shows a common use of box plots: to compare one measure across multiple dimensions.</p>

<p>A box plot is computed by choosing series of aggregate values over the distribution—usually the median and the quartiles—for the continuous variable. Other implementations choose instead to render the mean and standard deviations of a distribution.</p>

<p>The density plot shows how two variables change together.

In the categorical version, it can be used to find how often different pairs of variables go together.</p>

<p>As in a histogram, continuous variables are bucketed. Each cell contains the number of items in which a pair of values co-occur. A density plot may also plot a continuous versus a categorical variable.</p>

<p>The density plot is a first cousin to the more familiar scatterplot. Where a scatterplot shows individual points, however, a density shows regions.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="scatterplots" data-secondary="density plots vs." id="idm140386944626224"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="density plots" data-secondary="scatterplots vs." id="idm140386944629552"></a> As a result, density plots are far more scalable than scatterplots. At a large number of points, a scatterplot can become a black blob, whereas a density plot can be tuned. Density plots come in many variants, including ones that highlight individual outliers, ones that use smooth curves to show density, and ones that choose non-square binning algorithms (see <a data-type="xref" href="#FurtherReadingSingleview">“Further Reading”</a>).<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="single views" data-secondary="how a measure is distributed" data-startref="ix_sinvimesdist" id="idm140386944625776"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="measures" data-secondary="how a measure is distributed" data-startref="ix_measdist" id="idm140386944624688"></a></p>

<dd>
<p>A bar or column chart is a common choice for comparing a single measure per group. A clustered bar chart provides two categories: a major one and a minor one. The task, then, can be more complex: users might compare bars within a cluster or between clusters, or compare the overall shapes of clusters to each other.</p>

<p>The bar chart is useful for comparing values across categories. Users are very good at tasks like mentally sorting bars, identifying extremes, and estimating the average and variance across bars.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Notes</dt>
<dd>
<p>Bars should be ordered in some reasonable order. If the categorical value is based on ordinal data—such as years—then they should be in that order. Otherwise, bars can be ordered from highest to lowest value. In a multiple-view or clustered bar chart, the order should remain consistent.</p>

<p>When a dataset is separated across a categorical variable, each category is sometimes referred to as a <em>series</em>; in a multiline chart or a clustered bar chart, each line or bar represents a series.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="series" id="idm140386944600256"></a></p>
</dd>
<dt>Limitations</dt>
<dd>
<p>A bar chart begins to be incomprehensible when there are too many categories, except in the case where the bar chart is showing individual values of bucketed, sequential data.  If the task is to cluster pairs of bars into groups based on their relative size, then a scatterplot (<a data-type="xref" href="#scatterplot">Figure 5-16</a>) might be a more appropriate tool.</p>

<p>A scatterplot places data points on perpendicular axes. The two major axes are used to lay out the points spatially; additional attributes can be used for color, size, or shape.</p>

<p>Scatterplots encourage the user to look at groupings in space. They can identify outliers or groups, such as the points that are in each cluster or the points that are along a main trendline. If the points are colored with an additional categorical variable, then they can address questions about whether different categories behave differently from each other.</p>

<p>A node-link view <a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="node-link views" id="idm140386944520688"></a>draws nodes representing data items, and lines representing links between them. In a force-directed layout such as <a data-type="xref" href="#network_view_chapter_six">Figure 5-19</a>, nodes and lines are placed so that connected nodes are nearer each other, while nodes that are not directly connected are further apart; these views help users identify clusters of interconnected nodes. A circular layout like <a data-type="xref" href="#circular_network_layout">Figure 5-20</a> maintains an ordering between nodes.</p>

<p>Node-link diagrams are good for understanding connection. A user may be able to pick out well-connected nodes, as well as identify clusters of nodes and isolates. In an ordered circular layout, it is easier to see similar nodes have similar patterns of connection.

<dt>Limitations</dt>
<dd>
<p>Node-link views are effective for showing only small networks. Researchers have found that the most successful node-link diagrams showed small networks with no more than 10–50 nodes and 20–100 links. At this scale, node-link diagrams are good at showing the overall structure of a sparse graph, although density has a strong impact on readability—a highly connected graph can lead to what’s known as a <em>hairball</em>.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="hairballs" id="idm140386944513136"></a> A very few, far larger networks visualized using node-link views have been successful in presenting the general shape of the network.

<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
<p>Geographical visualizations are an entire field in themselves.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="dotplot maps" id="idm140386944453056"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="geographical visualizations" id="idm140386944452448"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="choropleths" id="idm140386944451568"></a> The choice of choropleth and dotplot here represents just two classic charts from an extremely rich history. Choropleths fill in regions; dotplots place data at points of interest.</p>

<p>Maps can be used for understanding how places vary or are similar, for understanding regional differences, and more.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Notes</dt>
<dd>
<p>One great virtue of maps is that if the audience is reasonably familiar with the area, there is no actual need to label what the space means. Neither Figure <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="#choropleth_map">5-25</a> nor <a data-type="xref" data-xrefstyle="select:labelnumber" href="#dotplot_map">5-26</a> has a legend or labels on the states, which is a reasonable omission for people familiar with the geography of the United States.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Limitations</dt>
<dd>
<p>In a choropleth, a great deal of emphasis is given to land area even though size and population are unrelated—a high value in US states like Alaska or Montana (which have a very large area but a low population) might seem more significant than a high value in tiny Rhode Island (which has approximately the same population as Montana, but 1/145 of the land mass).</p>

<p>The spatial distribution of dots in a dotplot is the same, regardless of the dimension being shown with color. For example, most dotplot maps of the United States look somewhat the same: a lot of points on the East Coast, fewer on the West Coast, and fewer still in the center. This is true whether measuring number of millionaires, voters, or sinks sold.</p>

<p>Maps also have the disadvantage that they consume the most powerful encoding channels in the visualization toolbox—position and size—on an aspect that is held constant. This leaves less effective encoding channels like color for showing the dimension of interest.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="objects" data-secondary="location of, in geographical visualizations" data-startref="ix_objloc" id="idm140386944445648"></a></p>

<h1>Question: What Is in This Text?</h1>

<p>Visualizing textual data is a common user need. Unfortunately, there is no definitive technique for resolving it.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="single views" data-secondary="visualizing textual data" id="idm140386944441584"></a><a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="textual data, visualizing" id="idm140386944441072"></a> Most approaches fall into the same patterns that are discussed throughout this chapter. They can be found by operationalizing the question further: what is it that the analyst needs to know from the text? Some popular approaches start with counting patterns and frequencies of words or phrases and visualizing these patterns in line charts, bar charts, networks, and so on. There are many subtleties with regard to recognizing word roots and stemming, choosing what aspects to visualize, and handling a set of words with a very high cardinality.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="word clouds" id="idm140386944440688"></a></p>

</div></figure>
<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>
<dd>
<p>One popular choice for visualizing text is a word cloud. A word cloud is, at heart, something like a bar chart: entities are sized to their counts. It relaxes constraints on position and color, which then get assigned with fairly arbitrary layout algorithms. A word cloud allows the reader to understand the relative frequency of words, and roughly identifies the top handful of words.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Limitations</dt>
<dd>
<p>Perceptually, a word cloud can be challenging: long words, and letters with ascenders and descenders, can make size difficult to estimate. It might be more effective—if less visually interesting—to simply print a bar chart of word frequency.</p>

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>This chapter has examined several major classes of visualizations.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="encoding channels" data-secondary="shared, in major visualization types" id="idm140386944427072"></a> There are a set of shared encoding channels: the placement of items (spatial), color, size. There are also a number of perceptual rules used to help enhance the degree to which visualizations bring out distinctions in questions.</p>

<p>This ties back to the process of operationalization by linking the question to user needs.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="operationalization" data-secondary="linking the question to user need" id="idm140386944423952"></a> For example, imagine an analyst who wishes to create a visualization showing that stores in region A are more likely to sell blue jeans than stores in region B. The question that the data counseling process suggests to ask is, “What would it look like to show this?”</p>

<p>The analyst might decide to group stores together by region and show the sum of jeans sold, or the proportion of products. They might decide to plot them on a map. In the former case, they lose granularity (data on individual stores) at the gain of seeing overall trends. Plotting has the opposite effect: it may be hard to see trends against bigger population patterns.</p>

<h1>Further Reading</h1>

<p>The basic chart types are one of the most well-studied and explored areas of data visualization.<a data-type="indexterm" data-primary="bar charts" data-secondary="learning resources for" id="idm140386944421104"></a> This section highlights a (very) few core books:</p>

<p>Bertin, Jacques. <em role="citetitle">Semiology of Graphics: Diagrams, Graphs, Maps,</em> trans. William J. Berg (Redlands, CA: ESRI Press, 2010).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Jacques Bertin’s seminal volume is a dense and challenging read (and the English translation is imperfect). However, the work is a treasure trove. Bertin lays out the principles of good information design based on cartography, typography, color theory, and perception. He then walks through, in great detail, the advantages and disadvantages of different chart representations of datasets with qualitative, quantitative, and spatial data types.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Few, Stephen. <em role="citetitle">Information Dashboard Design: Displaying Data for At-a-Glance Monitoring</em> (Sebastopol, CA: O’Reilly, 2006).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Stephen Few takes an opinionated approach to creating information dashboards. In this book, he lays out basic principles of what makes for a good information dashboard. His notes apply both to the individual charts discussed in this chapter and the multiple views in <a data-type="xref" href="ch06.html#multiview">Chapter 6</a>.</p>

</ul>

<p>Wilkinson, Leland. <em role="citetitle">The Grammar of Graphics</em> (Mew York: Springer, 1999).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This book expresses a particular sequence of creating visuals by mapping from data through geometric primitives and placing them on scales. These core insights make it easy to generalize many visualization techniques and have influenced visualization systems from Tableau, to the <em>ggplot</em> package in R, to Vega.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Meirelles, Isabel. <em role="citetitle">Design for Information.</em> (Beverly, MA: Rockport Publishers, 2013).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Trained as a designer, Isabel Meirelles presents the history and best practices for understanding, critiquing, and creating visualizations from a design perspective.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Steele, Julie and Noah Illinski. <em role="citetitle">Designing Data Visualizations</em> (Sebastopol, CA: O’Reilly, 2011).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This is a useful guide to core visualizations, with a stronger emphasis on how to design and present visualizations.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Munzner, Tamara. <em role="citetitle">Visualization Analysis and Design</em> (Natick, MA: AK Peters/CRC Press, 2014).</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>This textbook is an overview of the state of the art of the data visualization field. It covers data abstraction, provides perceptual guidelines, and discusses faceting into multiple views. Many topics in this book were influenced by Munzner’s approach.</p>

<p>This brief and readable journal article builds a hierarchy of core perceptual tasks in visualization. Its insight is that comparing length is the core perceptual task of a bar chart, whereas comparing angle is core to a pie chart. Comparing these two perceptual tasks can help evaluate the difficulty of understanding a visualization.</p>

<p class="docText"><a id="id1e619"></a><strong>1. Care About Your Craft xix</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Why spend your life developing software unless you care about doing it well?</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e630"></a><strong>2. Think! About Your Work xix</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Turn off the autopilot and take control. Constantly critique and appraise your work.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e928"></a><strong>3. Provide Options, Don't Make Lame Excuses 3</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Instead of excuses, provide options. Don't say it can't be done; explain what can be done.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e1052"></a><strong>4. Don't Live with Broken Windows. 5</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Fix bad designs, wrong decisions, and poor code when you see them.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e1198"></a><strong>5. Be a Catalyst for Change. 8</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">You can't force change on people. Instead, show them how the future might be and help them participate in creating it.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e1216"></a><strong>6. Remember the Big Picture 8</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Don't get so engrossed in the details that you forget to check what's happening around you.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e1337"></a><strong>7. Make Quality a Requirements Issue 11</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Involve your users in determining the project's real quality requirements.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e1547"></a><strong>8. Invest Regularly in Your Knowledge Portfolio 14</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Make learning a habit.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e1689"></a><strong>9. Critically Analyze What You Read and Hear 16</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Don't be swayed by vendors, media hype, or dogma. Analyze information in terms of you and your project.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e1931"></a><strong>10. It's Both What You Say and theWay You Say It 21</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">There's no point in having great ideas if you don't communicate them effectively.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e2185"></a><strong>11. DRY—Don't Repeat Yourself 27</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e2492"></a><strong>12. Make It Easy to Reuse 33</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">If it's easy to reuse, people will. Create an environment that supports reuse.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e2619"></a><strong>13. Eliminate Effects Between Unrelated Things 35</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Design components that are self-contained, independent, and have a single, well-defined purpose.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e3201"></a><strong>14. There Are No Final Decisions 46</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">No decision is cast in stone. Instead, consider each as being written in the sand at the beach, and plan for change.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e3339"></a><strong>15. Use Tracer Bullets to Find the Target 49</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Tracer bullets let you home in on your target by trying things and seeing how close they land.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e3540"></a><strong>16. Prototype to Learn. 54</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Prototyping is a learning experience. Its value lies not in the code you produce, but in the lessons you learn.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e3773"></a><strong>17. Program Close to the Problem Domain 58</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Design and code in your user's language.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e4132"></a><strong>18. Estimate to Avoid Surprises 64</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Estimate before you start. You'll spot potential problems up front.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e4364"></a><strong>19. Iterate the Schedule with the Code. 69</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Use experience you gain as you implement to refine the project time scales.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e4563"></a><strong>20. Keep Knowledge in Plain Text. 74</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Plain text won't become obsolete. It helps leverage your work and simplifies debugging and testing.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e5051"></a><strong>21. Use the Power of Command Shells 80</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Use the shell when graphical user interfaces don't cut it.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e5211"></a><strong>22. Use a Single Editor Well 82</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">The editor should be an extension of your hand; make sure your editor is configurable, extensible, and programmable.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="page_ifc-2"></a><a id="id1e5539"></a><strong>23. Always Use Source Code Control 88</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Source code control is a time machine for your work—you can go back.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e5712"></a><strong>24. Fix the Problem, Not the Blame 91</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">It doesn't really matter whether the bug is your fault or someone else's—it is still your problem, and it still needs to be fixed.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e5741"></a><strong>25. Don't Panic When Debugging 91</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Take a deep breath and THINK! about what could be causing the bug.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e5969"></a><strong>26. "select" Isn't Broken. 96</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">It is rare to find a bug in the OS or the compiler, or even a third-party product or library. The bug is most likely in the application.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e6010"></a><strong>27. Don't Assume It—Prove It 97</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Prove your assumptions in the actual environment with real data and boundary conditions.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e6163"></a><strong>28. Learn a Text Manipulation Language 100</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">You spend a large part of each day working with text. Why not have the computer do some of it for you?</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e6370"></a><strong>29. Write Code That Writes Code 103</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Code generators increase your productivity and help avoid duplication.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e6583"></a><strong>30. You Can't Write Perfect Software 107</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Software can't be perfect. Protect your code and users from the inevitable errors.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e6823"></a><strong>31. Design with Contracts. 111</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Use contracts to document and verify that code does no more and no less than it claims to do.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e7536"></a><strong>32. Crash Early 120</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">A dead program normally does a lot less damage than a crippled one.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e7679"></a><strong>33. Use Assertions to Prevent the Impossible 122</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Assertions validate your assumptions. Use them to protect your code from an uncertain world.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e8094"></a><strong>34. Use Exceptions for Exceptional Problems 127</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Exceptions can suffer from all the readability and maintainability problems of classic spaghetti code. Reserve exceptions for exceptional things.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e8222"></a><strong>35. Finish What You Start. 129</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Where possible, the routine or object that allocates a resource should be responsible for deallocating it.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e9044"></a><strong>36. Minimize Coupling Between Modules 140</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Avoid coupling by writing "shy" code and applying the Law of Demeter.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e9366"></a><strong>37. Con.gure, Don't Integrate 144</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Implement technology choices for an application as configuration options, not through integration or engineering.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e9425"></a><strong>38. Put Abstractions in Code, Details in Metadata 145</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Program for the general case, and put the specifics outside the compiled code base.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e9736"></a><strong>39. Analyze Work.ow to Improve Concurrency 151</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Exploit concurrency in your user's workflow.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e9887"></a><strong>40. Design Using Services. 154</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Design in terms of services—independent, concurrent objects behind well-defined, consistent interfaces.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e10035"></a><strong>41. Always Design for Concurrency 156</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Allow for concurrency, and you'll design cleaner interfaces with fewer assumptions.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e10282"></a><strong>42. Separate Views from Models. 161</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Gain flexibility at low cost by designing your application in terms of models and views.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e10796"></a><strong>43. Use Blackboards to Coordinate Work.ow. 169</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Use blackboards to coordinate disparate facts and agents, while maintaining independence and isolation among participants.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e11058"></a><strong>44. Don't Program by Coincidence 175</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Rely only on reliable things. Beware of accidental complexity, and don't confuse a happy coincidence with a purposeful plan.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e11653"></a><strong>45. Estimate the Order of Your Algorithms 181</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Get a feel for how long things are likely to take before you write code.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e11727"></a><strong>46. Test Your Estimates. 182</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Mathematical analysis of algorithms doesn't tell you everything. Try timing your code in its target environment.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="page_ifc-3"></a><a id="id1e12023"></a><strong>47. Refactor Early, Refactor Often 186</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Just as you might weed and rearrange a garden, rewrite, rework, and re-architect code when it needs it. Fix the root of the problem.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e12545"></a><strong>48. Design to Test. 192</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Start thinking about testing before you write a line of code.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e12851"></a><strong>49. Test Your Software, or Your Users Will. 197</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Test ruthlessly. Don't make your users find bugs for you.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e12950"></a><strong>50. Don't UseWizard Code You Don't Understand 199</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Wizards can generate reams of code. Make sure you understand all of it before you incorporate it into your project.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e13076"></a><strong>51. Don't Gather Requirements—Dig for Them. 202</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Requirements rarely lie on the surface. They're buried deep beneath layers of assumptions, misconceptions, and politics.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e13148"></a><strong>52. Work with a User to Think Like a User 204</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">It's the best way to gain insight into how the system will really be used.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e13320"></a><strong>53. Abstractions Live Longer than Details. 209</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Invest in the abstraction, not the implementation. Abstractions can survive the barrage of changes from different implementations and new technologies.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e13381"></a><strong>54. Use a Project Glossary 210</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Create and maintain a single source of all the specific terms and vocabulary for a project.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e13582"></a><strong>55. Don't Think Outside the Box—Find the Box 213</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">When faced with an impossible problem, identify the real constraints. Ask yourself: "Does it have to be done this way? Does it have to be done at all?"</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e13701"></a><strong>56. Start When You're Ready 215</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">You've been building experience all your life. Don't ignore niggling doubts.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e13789"></a><strong>57. Some Things Are Better Done than Described 218</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Don't fall into the specification spiral—at some point you need to start coding.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e13872"></a><strong>58. Don't Be a Slave to Formal Methods 220</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Don't blindly adopt any technique without putting it into the context of your development practices and capabilities.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e13923"></a><strong>59. Costly Tools Don't Produce Better Designs 222</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Beware of vendor hype, industry dogma, and the aura of the price tag. Judge tools on their merits.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e14167"></a><strong>60. Organize Teams Around Functionality 227</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Don't separate designers from coders, testers from data modelers. Build teams the way you build code.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e14338"></a><strong>61. Don't Use Manual Procedures 231</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">A shell script or batch file will execute the same instructions, in the same order, time after time.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e14741"></a><strong>62. Test Early. Test Often. Test Automatically. 237</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Tests that run with every build are much more effective than test plans that sit on a shelf.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e14775"></a><strong>63. Coding Ain't Done 'Til All the Tests Run 238</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">'Nuff said.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e15142"></a><strong>64. Use Saboteurs to Test Your Testing. 244</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Introduce bugs on purpose in a separate copy of the source to verify that testing will catch them.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e15205"></a><strong>65. Test State Coverage, Not Code Coverage 245</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Identify and test significant program states. Just testing lines of code isn't enough.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e15277"></a><strong>66. Find Bugs Once 247</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Once a human tester finds a bug, it should be the last time a human tester finds that bug. Automatic tests should check for it from then on.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e15378"></a><strong>67. English is Just a Programming Language 248</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Write documents as you would write code: honor the DRY principle, use metadata, MVC, automatic generation, and so on.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e15389"></a><strong>68. Build Documentation In, Don't Bolt It On. 248</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Documentation created separately from code is less likely to be correct and up to date.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e15818"></a><strong>69. Gently Exceed Your Users' Expectations 255</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Come to understand your users' expectations, then deliver just that little bit more.</p>
<p class="docText"><a id="id1e15985"></a><strong>70. Sign Your Work 258</strong></p>
<p class="docText2">Craftsmen of an earlier age were proud to sign their work. You should be, too.</p>
